The epidermis was then carefully removed by tearing the tissue with sterile forceps (at this point another set of sterile forceps was employed to avoid cell-contaminants from other organs). Sub-dissected epidermis was washed several times with hibernation medium prior seeding to a 0.1% gelatin-coated flask in HEF medium (DMEM-GlutaMAX, 5% FBS, 1% Sodium Puryvate, 1% Non-essential amino acids) supplemented with 50 ug/ml Gentamicin."
